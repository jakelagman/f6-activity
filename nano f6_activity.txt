git init
Version control is important in collaborative projects because it helps teams track changes and identify who made specific edits. It prevents files from being overwritten and ensures that everyone works with the most updated version. Version control also allows developers to revert to previous versions in case errors occur. Additionally, it keeps project history organized and easy to review.
